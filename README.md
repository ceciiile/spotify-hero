## Background

Spotify-hero started for several reasons :
* lack of good web platform to play osu!mania/Guitar-Hero style games
* using famous solutions like [OSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) requires to download the beatmaps wanted on the device before playing : making the game painful when it comes to change from a device to another
* no real cross-platform version PC & Android/IOS
* copyright issues faced by OSU when it comes to download/upload tracks made by users using Copyrighted songs : (.osz files for example [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/745984#osu/1572427) contains an illegal version of the song encoded in mp3)

We decided to start coding **spotify-hero** during a Web Development course at [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/) as the final project and to continue it even after being graded :construction_worker::chart_with_upwards_trend:.

## Features
* play osu!mania/Guitar-Hero style game with 4 rows of incoming notes
* use your Spotify account to play copyrighted music
* allow users to create their own beatmaps : recording notes played by user and associate spotify tracks

## Play

**Walkthrough**
1. Click [here](https://spotify-hero.herokuapp.com/) to open the app in your browser
2. Click on
    * **Play** if you have a **premium** Spotify account (recommended to be able to play our entire database) and **login** with your account
    * **try-me** if you don't and want to play with the few MP3s we uploaded
3. Select a track by clicking on its album's cover
4. Enjoy ! :tada:

## Install

> First you have to set-up your developper account [here](https://developer.spotify.com/), create a new app (i.e "spotify-hero") and defined a redirect URL : http://localhost:8888/spotify_cb/

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spotify-hero/spotify-hero.git
cd spotify-hero-Hero
npm install
```
> Now we will use **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your new app on the Spotify Developper Dashboard

Create the following file *run.sh* with the following scipt :
``` bash
#!/bin/bash
PORT=8888 CLIENT_ID=xxx CLIENT_SECRET=xxx REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/spotify_cb/ nodemon index.js
```

You can now launch the script 
``` bash
./run.sh
```

And open your favorite browser at http://localhost:8888/

## Technologies
During this project we used different libraries to create the game itself :

- **Vanilla Javascript** was used throughout much of this project. The object oriented programming aspects were utilized with classes to separate and organize the code.

- **Three.js** library was used for all the 3D animation throughout the game.

But also tools to make our app faster :

- **Travis CI** to run unit & integration tests
- **Heroku** to deploy our app on the internet
- **Webpack** to create a bundle of the code in order to reduce size and thus loading time for end-users

## Sources
First, we are very grateful to [@jyschwrtz](https://github.com/jyschwrtz) who allowed us, with his projet [JS-Hero](https://github.com/jyschwrtz/JS-Hero), to start from a solid codebase using [three.js](https://threejs.org/)

We also found very useful ressources which helped us a lot :children_crossing:
- [the Spotify Web SDK quickstart](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/)
- [the Spotify API Oauth examples](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples)
